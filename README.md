# CSE 6040 Introduction to Computing for Data Analysis - Spring 2018

CSE 6040 is 1 of the 3 core courses in Georgia Tech's Masters in Analytics program.

This course is hands-on introduction to programming techniques relevant to data analysis and machine learning with mini projects on how to "build from scratch", the basic components of a data analysis pipeline: collection, preprocessing, storage, analysis and visualization. 

Course highlights are:
* Concepts and techniques for formalizing data analysis questions into mathematical or computational tasks
* Methods for translating computational tasks into code
* Elementary data processing algorithms
* Notions of program correctness and efficiency
* Numerical methods for linear algebra and mathematical optimization
